CSWP - Community Shader & Weather Pack

This resource/project was started in 05/2013 as one man project by Sam@ke. In fact of very good
HLSL knowledge he was corresponding with "Ren_172" who gives very good help and his own resources 
as examples or for usage directly. While stucking on different issue큦 and for improving resource 
quality this project was released as OpenSource GPLv3 source on 19/09/2013 at GitHub:

https://github.com/Samake/CSWP

Feel free to use parts of this resource for your own Non-Commercial projects.

Best wishes,
Sam@ke
